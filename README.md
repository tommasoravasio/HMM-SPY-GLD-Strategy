# Regime-Aware SPY / GLD Allocation with Hidden Markov Models

Probabilistic tactical allocation between US equities (SPY) and Gold (GLD) using rolling Hidden Markov Models (HMM). The notebook implements and compares:

1. Gaussian HMM (2 latent regimes) on weekly SPY returns.
2. GMM-HMM (mixture emissions) to capture fat tails and multi‑modality.
3. Bivariate GMM-HMM adding a realized volatility feature.
4. Dividend / total-return benchmark comparison using `^SP500TR`.

Goal: Improve drawdown profile and risk-adjusted returns (Sharpe) versus long-only SPY and a naive 50/50 static SPY/GLD blend, while retaining interpretability (two macro regimes: risk‑on vs risk‑off).

## Core Idea
Equity returns are generated by latent market regimes. If we can infer the probability of transitioning into / being in a stressed regime, we can size a defensive allocation (GLD) proportionally to that probability instead of binary switching. This smooth hedge aims to cut downside while preserving compounding.

## Simplifying Assumptions 

* Risk‑free rate assumed 0 for Sharpe 
* Zero transaction costs, slippage, and market impact 
* Dividend timing approximated via `^SP500TR` proxy, assumes negligible tracking difference vs true SPY total return.

## Results
- **Univariate GMM-HMM strategy:**
    - Delivered +2.2% CAGR and +6.6% Sharpe improvement over the naive 50/50 SPY/GLD benchmark.
    - Reduced maximum drawdown by -15.3% and average drawdown by -6.7% compared to long-only SPY.
- **Gaussian HMM:**
    - Improved drawdowns but traded off some CAGR.
- **Bivariate GMM-HMM (with realized volatility):**
    - Showed no meaningful gain due to feature noise and short window length.
- **Overall:**
    - Univariate GMM-HMM provided the best balance of simplicity and performance.
    - Stabilized regime probabilities and delivered superior risk-adjusted returns in this iteration.

## Quick Start
Clone & install (recommend Python 3.10+):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tommasoravasio/HMM-SPY-GLD-Strategy.git
cd HMM-SPY-GLD-Strategy
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Open `hmm_strategy.ipynb` and run all cells. First run will download and cache data into `data/`.

## Final Model Summary: Univariate GMM-HMM

| Aspect        | Choice                  | Rationale                                                        |
|---------------|------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Regimes       | 2                      | Allows interpretability with two clear risk-on and risk-off regimea |
| Window        | 104 weeks              | Provides enough history for robust regime detection while remaining responsive to market changes. |
| Emissions     | GMM (n_mix=3)          | Captures fat tails and skew in SPY returns |
| Features      | Weekly SPY returns      | Simple and avoids noise from additional features.           |
| Allocation    | Prob    | Sizes GLD allocation proportional to regime probability.     |
